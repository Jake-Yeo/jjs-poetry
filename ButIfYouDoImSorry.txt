You and I used to make pinky promises back then.






















I’d promise to finish my homework and chores,






















I’d promise to get a 90% or above on the next calculus test,






















I’d talk more, be more outgoing,






















And that I’d never break a pinky promise.






















Yet here we are, years later.






















I see that you’re..






















Not disappointed,






















Nor angry,






















Or satisfied.






















But I see that your eyes are closed,






















Perhaps you’re imagining me huddled,






















Surrounded by a mess that I made.






















Or maybe you’re dreaming of a “What if”.






















But I always keep my promises, or at least I say I do.






















Because with friends and family I do,






















But I realize I never fulfilled one for you.






















Maybe it’s a lack of pressure,






















And I wish you would confront me more.






















But you’re so quiet.






















Too afraid, anxious, conformative.






















But sheep can’t be shepherds






















So I guess some promises are meant to be forgotten,






















Like a single rose wilting on a forgotten grave,






















Or a fading photo in an abandoned house.






















And I see all your dreams and hopes at the end of a long tunnel…






















But clocks spin so fast.






















So if somehow you remember me again, years down the line,






















I hope you have no regrets.
