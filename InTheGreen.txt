<Space22>
Together we listened to the secrets of leaves.
<Space22>
We biked up and down muddy slopes.
<Space22>
Making way for passersby along the way,
<Space22>
Taking in the rain that had no place to go.
<Space22>
Together we remembered the distinct smell of petrichor.
<Space22>
A smell of cold rain, loud thunder, gray clouds, but at the same time, 
<Space22>
Warmth.
<Space22>
Not warmth from laying in bed with a dystopian novel,
<Space22>
Listening to the peltering rain.
<Space22>
But warmth from the jacket I had to wear in the rain…
<Space22>
Because my friends pulled me out to bike to a big gray rock along a hillside
<Space22>
To see its timeless gaze, its rough touch,
<Space22>
And the RGB colored children's hospital that laid along the horizon.
<Space22>
But they also gave me a glimpse into the past.
<Space22>
A 1960 Volkswagen Beetle laying upright in a puddle right along the path.
<Space22>
Spray painted all over with layers of dull colors;
<Space22>
Naked and scavenged.
<Space22>
I think back about how much I regretted going to the rock,
<Space22>
Not because of the cold, not because of the rain
<Space22>
But because of the journey back,
<Space22>
Where we had to hike our bikes up two steep hills along a sewer line.
<Space22>
I promised myself I’d never do that again, I would never go back,
<Space22>
That the leg and stomach cramps weren’t worth it.
<Space22>
But every time I heard a familiar knock on the door,
<Space22>
I’d crack it open three inches and whisper “Gimme three minutes”.
<Space22>
But that was back then,
<Space22>
When I could still sense the rain.
