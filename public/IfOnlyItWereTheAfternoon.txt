I shrouded a sheet in gray




































To form cities and forests,








Beauty and melancholy.








But I guess some things just can’t be formed








Like how easily crumpled sheets and gray dust can,








Or how the sun paints the skies for each rise and fall.




































And I don’t feel okay.




































Because I can barely make out unfinished cities of ruins








From the kingdoms of marble and stone I tried to carve.








Because hiding their blueprints in a book's graceful words do not help.








But it did veil my shame.








It hid my dreams from judging onlookers.





































Because I am afraid.





































I am afraid of being remembered,








As the one whose faces were always stark, blemished or flawed;








Whose cities crumbled under the gentle touch of the breeze;








Whose lines looked like frayed worn down ropes.




































And I am frustrated.





































Because I can’t make bricks that hold their weight,








And I can’t seem to cast shadows like the sun and the moon.








I am frustrated because the stars shine without me;








So I am left alone to stack mounds of paper just to touch the sky.





































But I guess that is okay.




































Because I see the puppy with an “adopt me” sign whimpering in the corner;








I see the jewelry shop filled with rings and necklaces with 25% discounts;








I see an empty coffee shop, waiting for its first customer every morning,








And the sun still paints the skies for each rise and fall.





































But it’s 3:00 am on a Monday, and I have school in the morning.
