<Space22>
I shrouded a sheet in gray
<Space36>
To form cities and forests,
<Space7>
Beauty and melancholy.
<Space7>
But I guess some things just can’t be formed
<Space7>
Like how easily crumpled sheets and gray dust can,
<Space7>
Or how the sun paints the skies for each rise and fall.
<Space36>
And I don’t feel okay.
<Space36>
Because I can barely make out unfinished cities of ruins
<Space7>
From the kingdoms of marble and stone I tried to carve.
<Space7>
Because hiding their blueprints in a book's graceful words do not help.
<Space7>
But it did veil my shame.
<Space7>
It hid my dreams from judging onlookers.
<Space36>
Because I am afraid.
<Space36>
I am afraid of being remembered,
<Space7>
As the one whose faces were always stark, blemished or flawed;
<Space7>
Whose cities crumbled under the gentle touch of the breeze;
<Space7>
Whose lines looked like frayed worn down ropes.
<Space36>
And I am frustrated.
<Space36>
Because I can’t make bricks that hold their weight,
<Space7>
And I can’t seem to cast shadows like the sun and the moon.
<Space7>
I am frustrated because the stars shine without me;
<Space7>
So I am left alone to stack mounds of paper just to touch the sky.
<Space36>
But I guess that is okay.
<Space36>
Because I see the puppy with an “adopt me” sign whimpering in the corner;
<Space7>
I see the jewelry shop filled with rings and necklaces with 25% discounts;
<Space7>
I see an empty coffee shop, waiting for its first customer every morning,
<Space7>
And the sun still paints the skies for each rise and fall.
<Space36>
But it’s 3:00 am on a Monday, and I have school in the morning.
<Space7>
