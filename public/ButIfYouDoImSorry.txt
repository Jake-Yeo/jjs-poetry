<Space22>
You and I used to make pinky promises back then.
<Space22>
I’d promise to finish my homework and chores,
<Space22>
I’d promise to get a 90% or above on the next calculus test,
<Space22>
I’d talk more, be more outgoing,
<Space22>
And that I’d never break a pinky promise.
<Space22>
Yet here we are, years later.
<Space22>
I see that you’re..
<Space22>
Not disappointed,
<Space22>
Nor angry,
<Space22>
Or satisfied.
<Space22>
But I see that your eyes are closed,
<Space22>
Perhaps you’re imagining me huddled,
<Space22>
Surrounded by a mess that I made.
<Space22>
Or maybe you’re dreaming of a “What if”.
<Space22>
But I always keep my promises, or at least I say I do.
<Space22>
Because with friends and family I do,
<Space22>
But I realize I never fulfilled one for you.
<Space22>
Maybe it’s a lack of pressure,
<Space22>
And I wish you would confront me more.
<Space22>
But you’re so quiet.
<Space22>
Too afraid, anxious, conformative.
<Space22>
But sheep can’t be shepherds
<Space22>
So I guess some promises are meant to be forgotten,
<Space22>
Like a single rose wilting on a forgotten grave,
<Space22>
Or a fading photo in an abandoned house.
<Space22>
And I see all your dreams and hopes at the end of a long tunnel…
<Space22>
But clocks spin so fast.
<Space22>
So if somehow you remember me again, years down the line,
<Space22>
I hope you have no regrets.
