<Space22>
Deep in the snow, he carved a path back home.
<Space22>
He walked carefully above the fragile ice crackling out to the frigid sky.
<Space22>
Back home, the orange glow of the fire found refuge on his cheek.
<Space22>
Its soul caresses his face with tendrils of warmth from its shimmering flame.
<Space22>
And he waited,
<Space22>
Atop on a glossy wooden chair decorated by a topographic grain,
<Space22>
For a bowl of precious rice jewels,
<Space22>
Embraced by the extracts of ginger and pandan.
<Space22>
But it never came.
<Space22>
His family bathed in sunlight,
<Space22>
And his friends were entombed in ice.
<Space22>
So he left the safe grasp of warmth,
<Space22>
Trekking miles deep into frostbitten air.
<Space22>
And he jumped into a lake of icy waters.
