Together we listened to the secrets of leaves.






















We biked up and down muddy slopes.






















Making way for passersby along the way,






















Taking in the rain that had no place to go.






















Together we remembered the distinct smell of petrichor.






















A smell of cold rain, loud thunder, gray clouds, but at the same time, 






















Warmth.






















Not warmth from laying in bed with a dystopian novel,






















Listening to the peltering rain.






















But warmth from the jacket I had to wear in the rain…






















Because my friends pulled me out to bike to a big gray rock along a hillside






















To see its timeless gaze, its rough touch,






















And the RGB colored children's hospital that laid along the horizon.






















But they also gave me a glimpse into the past.






















A 1960 Volkswagen Beetle laying upright in a puddle right along the path.






















Spray painted all over with layers of dull colors;






















Naked and scavenged.






















I think back about how much I regretted going to the rock,






















Not because of the cold, not because of the rain






















But because of the journey back,






















Where we had to hike our bikes up two steep hills along a sewer line.






















I promised myself I’d never do that again, I would never go back,






















That the leg and stomach cramps weren’t worth it.






















But every time I heard a familiar knock on the door,






















I’d crack it open three inches and whisper “Gimme three minutes”.






















But that was back then,






















When I could still sense the rain.
