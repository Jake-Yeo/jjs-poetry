Yesterday, snowflakes glided in the red allure of the sky.

Today, the snow just hovers, glistening the same red, but on fractured ice.

Yesterday, two birds bathed in blue, flying together across trees and parks.

Today, they bath in the rain of gray clouds, lost and cold.

Yesterday, fish swam through a tranquil pond shimmering in the light.

Today, they drift across a vast endless ocean, veiled in darkness.

Yesterday, the leaves whispered a lullaby in the gentle breeze.

Today, the dried up voices of orange and brown leaves fill the silence of bare trees.

Yesterday, a sea of fire roared across the plains.

Today, a weak amber glow remains, fragile embers flying with the wind.
