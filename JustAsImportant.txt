Deep in the snow, he carved a path back home.

He walked carefully above the fragile ice crackling out to the frigid sky.

Back home, the orange glow of the fire found refuge on his cheek.

Its soul caresses his face with tendrils of warmth from its shimmering flame.

And he waited,

Atop on a glossy wooden chair decorated by a topographic grain,

For a bowl of precious rice jewels,

Embraced by the extracts of ginger and pandan.

But it never came.

His family bathed in sunlight,

And his friends were entombed in ice.

So he left the safe grasp of warmth,

Trekking miles deep into frostbitten air.

And he jumped into a lake of icy waters.
